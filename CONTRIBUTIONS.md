If you'd like your contributions to be displayed in the repo readme, do the following:

In an issue or pull request, simply comment the following: 

`@all-contributors please add @[github username] for [contribution]`


NOTE: Multiple contributions can be added at the same time. You can find the contribution types
[here](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key).

For example:

`@all-contributors please add @tbenning for design`

`@all-contributors please add @AlexanderTheGrape for bug design`

The bot should then comment in the same issue/pull request with a link to a pull request
it'll have made to the master branch. Get this checked and approved by others, and then
you'll see your amazing contributions in the readme on github!
